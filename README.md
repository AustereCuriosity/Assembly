# Assembly

This repository contains NASM codes for string and numeric operations based on x86 architecture. 

These codes are meant to be used as an educational resource to learn and practice Assembly Language programming. I believe that solving even the most basic string and numerical computation problems using Assembly Language requires extensive organised efforts, and strong analytical skills. Thus, I encourage students to try Assembly programming atleast once in their lifetime!

Drawing from my own experience, the best way to get started with Assembly is to write a Mathematical Model for the chosen problem, and then realise the steps in the most straightforward way possible. After doing so, you should look at different implementations for the same problem. This will help in knowing better thinking strategies, and better implementation features supported by Assembly.

Do try the programs I have solved here!
